      About the Tribe
    </h1>
    <p>
      The Duwamish tribe were the first inhabitants of the Puget Sound region, thought to have migrated here via the Ice Bridge during the last Ice Age over 10,000 years ago. They survived mostly off of resources from the Duwamish River, relying on the area for fish, deer, and berries. During the 1800s white settlers came and took advantage of the Duwamish people, settling in the land, and tricking the former into signing unfavorable treaties, most notably the Treaty of Point Elliott, which promised land reservations and promised peace in exchange for rights to the land. To this day, the United States government has not followed up on the promises made in the Treaty of Point Elliott, and the Duwamish Tribe is not currently recognized by the federal government. Today, the tribe is led by Cecile Hansen, descendant of Chief Seattle. The tribe currently has around 600 enrolled members, but many people of Duwamish ancestry enroll with other tribes for the benefits that come with federal recognition.

    <p>
      The Duwamish Tribe Longhouse is located in West Seattle near the mouth of the Duwamish River. The Longhouse acts as both a museum to spread public knowledge of the Duwamish people and their history as well as a central hub for workshops and events available to the public.
