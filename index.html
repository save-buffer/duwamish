	About the Tribe
      </h1>
      <p>
	<img src="Seattle.jpg" alt="Chief Seattle" height="400" width = "auto" style="float:right;">
	The Duwamish tribe were the first inhabitants of the Puget Sound region, thought to have migrated here from the Ice Bridge during the last Ice Age over 10,000 years ago. They survived mostly off of resources from the Duwamish River, relying on the area for fish, deer, and berries. They lived in longhouses built from cedar. In 1855 they signed the Point Elliott Treaty, which promised reservations and compensation in exchange for rights to the land. While settlers named the land after the tribe's Chief Seattle and burned the tribe's longhouses to the ground, the Duwamish tribe assimilated into mainstream culture after finding the land granted them far too small to house their people. To this day, the United States government has yet to fulfil the agreements made in the treaty or grant the tribe federal recognition.
      </p>
      <p>
	The tribe is led by Cecile Hansen, descendant of Chief Seattle, namesake of the City of Seattle. The tribe currently has around 600 enrolled members, a result of Duwamish descendants enrolling with other tribes for the benefits that come with their federal recognition. Despite these setbacks, the tribe continues to fight for federal recognition as Metropolitan Seattle's original inhabitants.

	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Duwamish Longhouse represents the Duwamish Tribe's first home since 1894. Located in West Seattle near the mouth of the Duwamish River, the longhouse acts as both a museum to preserve the tribe's history and as a center for both the tribe and outsiders to celebrate Duwamish heritage and culture.
