	About the Tribe
      </h1>
      <img src="Seattle.jpg" alt="Chief Seattle" height="400" width = "auto" />
      <p>
	The Duwamish tribe were the first inhabitants of the Puget Sound region, thought to have migrated here from the Ice Bridge during the last Ice Age over 10,000 years ago. They survived mostly off of resources from the Duwamish River, relying on the area for fish, deer, and berries. They lived in longhouses built from cedar. In 1855 they signed the Point Elliott Treaty, which promised reservations and compensation in exchange for rights to the land. While settlers named the land after the tribe's Chief Seattle and burned the tribe's longhouses to the ground, the Duwamish tribe assimilated into mainstream culture after finding the land granted them far too small to house their people. To this day, the United States government has yet to fulfil the agreements made in the treaty or grant the tribe federal recognition.
      </p>
      <p>
	The tribe is led by Cecile Hansen, descendant of Chief Seattle, namesake of the City of Seattle. The tribe currently has around 600 enrolled members, a result of Duwamish descendants enrolling with other tribes for the benefits that come with their federal recognition. Despite these setbacks, the tribe continues to fight for federal recognition as Metropolitan Seattle's original inhabitants.

      <p>
	The Duwamish Longhouse is a traditional cedar post and beam structure designed in the Puget Salish Longhouse style as collaboration between the Duwamish Tribe and project architect Byron Barnes, a member of the Montana based Blackfeet Tribe. The Longhouse - as in ancient times - is the site where tribal business is conducted and cultural and educational events are held. In addition, the Duwamish Tribe wants to share its Longhouse with the public to reinforce its cultural and social traditions. Monthly special events as well as ongoing workshops, demonstrations and lectures are available to the public. School tours provide children with an introduction to the Duwamish Tribe and Salish People. 
      </p>
      <p>
	The Duwamish Longhouse is also an important regional resource for tribal members, researchers, teachers and students interested in Duwamish history and culture. Historic photographs and associated material collected by historians and researchers are also available. Lushootseed language materials on CDs, tapes, and videos have been researched and compiled by tribal elder, Vi Hilbert. Select pieces from the adjacent ancient villages, on loan from the Burke Museum, MOHAI, and the Port of Seattle are also displayed in secure, humidity controlled display cases with bilingual signage and interpretation. We hope you will come and visit us soon so we can share with you our Longhouse, and the culture and traditions of Seattle's first people - the Duwamish Tribe.
